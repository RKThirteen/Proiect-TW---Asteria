# Asteria - Passion Project

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were made last year during my front-end course

This started out as a project that i wanted to build in order for my friends to showcase pictures they loved and even art they made, but i haven't had the opportunity to come back to it until now

My goal now is to turn it into a fully fledged web application that has both front end and back end

# Tasks

Implement a database(local)
Implement Posts as an Object
Implement Users

# Optional

Search posts via their name or after a specific date
Messages from other users(even pictures allowed!)
And whatever else!
